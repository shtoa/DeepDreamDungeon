# Deep Dream Dungeon
---
Deep Dream Dungeon is a simulated multidimensional walking simulator where the player traverses various pre-generated deep dreamified environments using a portal gun in addition to using their face to control their destination. The project's goal was to create an explorable environment using stable diffusion whilst using face-tracking to let the player take control of the surrounding environment.
